## Objectives

* Provide vaccination schedules for infants
* Will schedule upcoming vaccination dates if not already taken

## Introduction

This application aims to provide users the ability to manage their kids’ vaccination profiles. 
Users can register themselves in the application and add their kids’ information along with previously taken vaccinations. Vaccine Monitor will then offer the remaining vaccines to the user, so that users can request for vaccination.  
Once a user chooses and requests a vaccine for their kid, this request will be forwarded to the admin for verification.
Admin will then approve the vaccination according to available slots.  


  

## Implementation

This application is developed using java language.
I have used the javafx graphical toolkit to design the ui components of the application.  
Gluon Scene Builder was used to design the app through javafx.  
For the database to store the users and kids information we used DB Browser for SQLITE. This database uses basic sql syntaxes.  
To connect the application to the database we used sqlite jdbc jar file.
